# IO hacks hackathon
This is a hackathon project for the IO hacks hackathon

This is meant to be a pandemic simulator, which uses a SIR model of infection.

SIR stands for suceptible, infectious, and recovered

we add a layer to the infected, and ad an infectious stage, as you dont immediately start transmitting when you get infected.

We also split up dead, and immune in the revered part of the model.
